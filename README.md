# spotify-dl
spotify-dl downloads all of your spotify saved tracks as mp3s with relevant metadata including album art. The tracks are downloaded from youtube videos and are checked against a music database via audio fingerprinting. This project started as a submission at Brickhack 2017.

# To Do
- Normalize volume
- Check youtube hits for highest audio quality
- Compare mp3 from youtube with sample from spotify (instead of using acrcloud)

# Dependencies
- python2.7
- spotipy
- google python api
- youtube-dl
- acr cloud
